# Claude Notifications Project

## Quick Context
This is the Claude SMS notification system project. When resuming work:
1. Check if notification server is running: `npm start`
2. Check if monitor is running: `./start-monitor.sh status`
3. Current branch: main
4. GitHub: https://github.com/Trolzie/claude-notifications

## Current State (as of 2025-01-28)
- âœ… Basic system working - sends SMS when Claude completes todos
- âœ… Repository created and documented
- ðŸ”„ Next: Add support for monitoring all Claude responses (not just todos)
